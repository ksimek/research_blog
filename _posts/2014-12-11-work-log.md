Reached out to Amy Tabb with the possibility of using her voxel reconstruction method to bootstrap the branching gaussian process.  She's offered to try it on our data, and if it works, perhaps there's a collaboration possible.  

Continuing to work on managing the Diadem dataset.  It is still downloading; meanwhile, I'm unraring the parts I have and resizing the ones I've unrared for easy viewing.  Some datasets need levels adjusted to see anything; imagemagick's -auto-level flag does a good enough job to get the gist of the dataset.

Working on incorporating new FIRE immunity data.  Some inconsistencies between the old and new data.  

* Some dates are inconsistent (e.g. mistaking July for June or vice-versa).
* I noticed that my old spreadsheet lost some decimal places, due to a combination of Excel formatting and unjudicious copy/pasting.  Needs fixing.
