Troubleshooting ML optimization.

Found a few bugs in the optimization code.

1. math bug in variable transformation formula.  Applying chain rule to account for transformation used wrong formula.
2. math bug in new version of gradient function.  Used S where S' was called for.

As a result of bug #2, decided to re-implement end-to-end test (which hadn't been run for some time; was running a unit test on synthetic data).  Refactored test to use the functional style in `test/test_ml_deriv.m`, added hessian computation.
