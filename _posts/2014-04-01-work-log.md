Continuing the process of resolving the "rotated dates" issue, in which the last gold-standard date was shifted to the beginning of each visit-set.

Laura has corrected the issue on her end, but we've already made several changes to our copies of the databases, so I wrote a script to make the correction
on our end.  But there was some confusion about whether the original or updated "Visit" values are correct.  Laura has sent me her databases so I can 
confirm that we're working with the same data, and hopefully I can determine if our visit values are correct and consistent with hers.

Data is in MS access, so will need to install it on my virtual machine.
