Implemented cluster model in `cluster_model.{cpp,h}`.  Implemented synthetic data generation in `synthetic.{cpp,h}`.  Working on initial model estimation using k-means.

Run #1:  Adding estimation of epsilon.
--------------------

**Description**: After estimating 'A', also estimate the noise scale, `epsilon` (assumed 1.0 until now).  
**Method**: Project data onto 'A' in data space, take mean projection error (see kjb_c::project_rows_onto_basis).

**Results**: 
    
    Using known epsilon: 0.5
    -------------------
    Training error: -45.3955
    Prediction error: -46.5

    Estimating epsilon: 0.46192
    ----------------------
    Training error: -45.7958
    Prediction error: -47.1319

**Discussion**: in the ballpark!

Run #2: initial cluster estimation
-------------

**Description**: Iteratively estimate three clusters and assign memebership.

**Issues**: third cluster initialization is identical to second.  Guess: it's picking the same bad point over and over.

Run #3: initial cluster estimation, per-cluster obs. model
-----

**Description**: Like Run #2, but each cluster has an individual observation model
