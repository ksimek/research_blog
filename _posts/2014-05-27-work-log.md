On the issue of HMC step size, I wondered if anyone had published on the relationship between ideal step size and the log-posterior's second derivative.  I found an answer in section 4.2 of [Neal 2011](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1901.pdf)[pdf], which poses the question in the context of a Gaussian-shaped posterior.  Using eigenvalue analysis, he shows that a step size larger than 2 standard deviations results in unstable dynamcis, and the state will diverge to infinity.  From Neal (2011):

> For low-dimensional problems, using a value for ε that is just a bit below the stability limit
> is suﬃcient to produce a good acceptance rate. For high-dimensional problems, however,
> the stepsize may need to be reduced further than this to keep the error in H to a level that
> produces a good acceptance probability
