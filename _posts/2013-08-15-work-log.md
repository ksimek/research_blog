Continuing from yesterday.

Tried changing index_delta from 0.5 to 0.25.  ML suddenly dropped a *lot*.  Realized that oversampling the smoothed curves causes significant degree of many-to-one, and our code prevents skipping more than one or two points during correspondences.  

**Main Idea:** Sampling period should be equal to (or close to) the data point-spacing.

Index-refinement
===================

Allow indices to correspond to continuous values between the samples.

Modified `correspondence/corr_to_likelihood.m` to post-process indices to search the neighboring line segments for a better value. Re-ran `tr_prep_likelihood` to reconstruct Corrs collection.  ML improves after fix.  

Need to confirm improved indexing by visualizing results.  See `experiments/exp_2013_08_15_visualize_indices.m`, still in progress.  Some apparent bugs in aforementioned changes, causing bad results.  Still investigating...

Mean-curve reconstruction
===========================

Last week, I derived the equation for finding the maximum posterior per-view reconstruction.  Now we have a formula for the unobserved mean curve, i.e. the curve that each view is perturbed from.  Iterestingly, they both have the same form:
    
<div>
\[
    \mu = K^* (S K + I)^{-1} S y
\]
</div>

Note that this is slightly different from the form used in a previous post.  This form is equivalent, and better reflects the form used by Williams and Rasmussen.

<div>Here, \(K\) is the prior covariance, \(S\) is the likelihood precision matrix, and \(y\) are the virtual observations in 3D.  \(K^*\) is the covariance between the observed points (columns) and the points to be predicted (rows). The difference between the per-view and the mean reconstruction is the form of \(K^*\):  for the per-view reconstruction, \(K^*\) uses the full prior covariance, whereas with the mean reconstruction, the perturb covariances are set to zero.</div>

Usage
------

Modified `curve_max_posterior_2.m` by adding an extra optional parameter, `kernel_2`.  If set, it assumes you want a mean reconstruction instead of a per-view reconstruction, and uses `kernel_2` to build \\(K*\\).

Added an extra flag to `experiments/exp_2013_08_11_reconstruct_for_web.m`, which if set to true, will also plot the mean curve.
