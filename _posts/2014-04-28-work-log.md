Got [ELSD](http://ubee.enseeiht.fr/vision/ELSD/) compiling and running on OS X.  Details [here](http://ksimek.github.io/2014/04/28/compiling-elsd-on-osx/).  [Results were very nice](http://ksimek.github.io/misc/elsd_results.html); will try to use them for ECCV. 

Working on `publish_results` function in matlab to store results in Experiment Log.
