Revisiting camera calibration -- can it be done automatically with opencv?

Can get a ballpark camera from a single pass of OpenCV: (1) extract chessboards, (2) calibrate.

pass 2: mask out previous chessboard and re-run
pass n: repeat until no new chessboards

Stage 2: find circular path
    
    For each estimated pose,
        1. get camera center and add to list
        1. get camera rotation and add to list
        2. Assume pattern is rotated 180-degrees, find camera center, add to list
        3. Repeat 1 and 2 five more times, once for each face of cube.

    Find a strong plane in cameras list (ransac)
    Find a circle in planar points (ransac)
        (there will be four points per camera on this circle, due to cube
         ambiguity.  use known rotation angle to prune extra points)
        For each camera pose, bring to canonical reference frame (pointing toward circle center).  Find average deviation (geodesic mean of quaternions).

    Estimate missing cameras by interpolation.

Stage 3: Dense point collection

    re-run opencv, this time masking each face using roughly known face position
        (avoids interference from mutliple faces)
        (use white mask to simulate white margin that opencv hope for)
        (Hopefully we get points on each face now)
        (points now correspond to same faces, so better calibration)
        (! possibly rectify top chessboard, to improve capture rate)
        (! conservatively mask to remove other faces, then mask everything but good face, leaving a large margin to allow for imperfactions)
    Re-run pairwise calibration in opencv
    Undistort images
    Run bundle adjustment in ceres solver

    This calibration occurs without assumptions about cube, which makes it robust to imperfect construction.

    POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS
        add some ceres solver constraints to ensure reconstruction is cube-like
            face points are equally spaced
            face points are in orthogonal grid
            faces are orthogonal
