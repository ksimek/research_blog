Track order issue
----------------

There are situations where ties between tracks are broken by giving priority to the track with lower index. For this reason, we should have a move where tracks randomly change order.


TODO
=====

Quick

* test three-levels of branching
    * reconstruction
    * ML vs. reference
* cleanup Corr fields
    * group fields by processing stage 
* map-out processing pipeline

Medium

* finish ground-truthing (Friday night, Saturday)
* implement recursive update
* code for inferring branching parameters.
* Finish training
    * infer branching parameters
    * re-write training ML
    * re-train prior parameters with full ML
        * jointly train FG and BG using same 
* MCMCDA sampler
    * association moves
    * split/merge moves
    * re-order moves
* evaluation code
