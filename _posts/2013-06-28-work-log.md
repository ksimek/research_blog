Profiling and optimizing `clean_correspondence3.m`

Huge bottleneck in `get_dtw_matches_()`.

Wrote MEX version of get_dtw_matches_(),  `get_dtw_matches_horiz.c`.   ~8x speedup

**New bottlenecks**

* projection_error_hessian
* `interp1` - linear interpolation
* `csaps` - spline smoothin
* dtw

Plan
--------

can possibly eliminate some calls to interp1.

could mex projecion_error_hessian.  should be a big win

DTW can be done in two passes, or mex'd

Mexing `projection_error_hessian`
--------------------------------

Tried using Matlab's "Coder" feature to generate mex code automatically.  The result was totally bloated (14 files!) and no faster than the matlab version.  Next I tried hand-coding the mex, and its ~10x faster.
