Training likelihood
------------------------

Fitting a three-component GMM resulted in a null model having a higher likelihood than the ground truth model.

Spent a lot of time troubleshooting this and finally realized I had scaled all values up by 100x so Matlab wouldn't choke, but I wasn't accounting for this when evaluating.  Blame it on this blasted cold, killing my focus!

Ground truth model looks much better than null model now.

Trying different blurring levels.  

* 1.0 is to small.
* 2.0 seems okay 
* 5.0 gives a wide variance for true-positives.

In the end, running max likleihood on this will be best, but this gives us a ballpark.

Trying to get KJB EM algorithm working on my 2M element dataset.  Getting NaN errors at the moment.
