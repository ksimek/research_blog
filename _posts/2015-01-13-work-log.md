Spent morning considering covariance over loopy graphs.  Implemented and example of "shortest geodesic distance", modified to be minimum sum of squared distances between junctions over all paths.  This is a generalization of our metric over tree-structured graphs.  As anticipated, with loopy graphs, this results in non-positive-definite covariance matrices.

Consider this example, with two paths between nodes (1) and (4), one twice as long as the other.

The shortest squared-distance matrix is

     0     1     4     9     4    13
     1     0     1     4     5     8
     4     1     0     1     8     5
     9     4     1     0    13     4
     4     5     8    13     0     4
    13     8     5     4     4     0
