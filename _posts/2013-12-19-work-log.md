Troubleshooting Jacobians of z and mu.  

Analytical and numerical versions of z's Jacobian differ significantly in some entries.  To troubleshoot, stepping backward through the derivations of J_z outlined in [the reference post]({{site.baseurl}}/2013/12/12/reference/).

I will refer to the final equation from that post and count backward from the final line, describing the result of implementing each line.  E.g. line 0 is the final result, the one used to compute z_ana; line 1 is the one labelled "(3D version)" .

Setup:

    Track = detach(trash_Tracks_11(end), params_test);
    K = get_K(Track); 
    S = Track.ll_S;
    U = speye(size(K)) + S * K * S';
    Ui = inv(U);
    kern = get_model_kernel_derivative(params_test);
    ind = get_curve_indices(Track);
    views = Track.ll_views_flat;
    Delta = eval_kernel(kern, ind, ind, views, views);
    Delta3 = one_d_to_three_d(Delta);
    
    i = 1;   
    i3 = 3*(i-1)+1;
    I = i3:i3+2;
    
    delta_i = Delta(i,:)';
    delta_i3 = one_d_to_three_d(delta_i);

    dK = zeros(size(K));
    dK(I,:) = dK(I,:) + Delta3(I,:);
    dK(:,I) = dK(:,I) + Delta3(I,:)';

    A = A = S' * Ui * S;
    z = z = A * y;
    N = length(K);


Implementing line 1: 

    line_1 = -A(:,I) *delta_i3' * z - A * delta_i3 * z(i3:i3+2);

It actually looks pretty good.  So why is line_0 wrong?

Let's isolate the first term.

    line_1_a = -A(:,I) *delta_i3' * z;
    line_0_a = -sum_1xN(A .* repmat((Delta3 * z)', N,1), 3);
    plot(xx, line_1_a - line_0_a(:,i))

Error within 1e-12.  Great!  Error must be in the second term...

    line_1_b = A * delta_i3 * z(i3:i3+2);
    line_0_b =  - A * (Delta3(1:3:end, :)' .* repmat(reshape(z,3,[]), N/3, 1));
    plot(xx, line_1_b - line_0_b(:,i))

Yep.  it's a mess.

...

Found the bug.  Was incorrectly trying to implement Delta_{1x3} by taking Delta_{3x3}(1:3:end, :), which is totally wrong.  Also, was mis-associating the matrix multiplication and elementwise multiplication.  That is, I was taking (A * Delta_1x3) .* XXX  instead of A * (Delta_1x3 .* XXX).

Those two fixes, and the dZ test now passes.

Still getting very bad results for dmu.
