{% include JB/setup %}

Implemented nonmaximal suppression, background subtraction.

Derived/implemented expression for cubic covariance function for negative time-points.

Tested/debugged branch parameter estimation.  Implemented a visualization that revealed several issues during optimization.  Found a bug in gradient, which improved performance.  Also realized that adding a constant perturbation per stem allows much better fitting for touching/crossing curves.  To implement this, I created a "hamming distance" covariance function, which adds a constant offset to each child.    Also, increasing the value on the diagonal improves gradient estimates, making optimization converge faster.

Incorporated parent estimation into end-to-end fitting routine.


Next:
--------
Post-tracking tasks:
  
* triangulate, smooth, etc
* shrink/grow stems in 3d
* implement 3rd-view fitting
* try adding new stems
** given current fit, run 2d stem finding

General procedure for fitting:

1. find a stem in 2D
2. estimate a perturbation in 2D  
3. triangulate and fit in 3rd view (w/ epipolar constraint)
4. attempt to infer parent
5. accept/reject


Open issues

* width fitting
* nonconstant width?
* fit independent curves independently?
