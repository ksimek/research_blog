Troubleshooting reconstruction anomalies.

* significant translational offset
* Why is reconstructed base point moving?  Initial points should be 100% corellated.


Observations during debugging:

* Observation indices start at negative values
* Initial point in view 2 is 5mm past initial point in view 9
* translational offset was due to auto-centering feature of `view_all_wacv.m`.  Changed default to "no auto centering"
