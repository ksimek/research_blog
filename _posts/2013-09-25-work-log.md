Coding swap and birth/death moves.

Lots of refactoring.

* new function `attachment/detach.m`; moved some code from attach to detach function.
* Reworked `kernel/` directory.
    * added function: `kernel/get_base_covariance.m`.  Used to implement detach.
    * new function: `kernel/get_model_temporal_kernel.m`.  Returns ind, ou, or sqexp kernel
    * Eliminated `kernel/*_perturb_model.m`.  `Get_model_kernel` now constructs these directly using `get_model_temporal_kernel`.
    * Reworked `kernel/get_model_kernel.m` to use get_model_temporal_kernel. 


Birth/Death Move
----------------

Implemented birth/death move.  New concept: birth and death candidate sets; on birth, candidate is moved from one to the other.

Migrating legacy sampling code
-----------------------------

Reworking old sampler code

* "sampling context" object; (see `inference/ctx_*`)
* offline construction of curve-pair (see `inference/offline_*`);

Refactoring Tracks (previously Corrs)
-------------------------------------

Continuing to update the codebase to use the new "Tracks" structure instead  of "Corrs".  

* New function `correspondence/build_empty_curveset.m`.  This is useful in two ways: (a) constructing an initial object before sampling begins, and (b) constructing a single track, which is now defined as a trackset of length 1.

To be continued...
--------------

* need to test `mcmc_birth_death.m`.  
    * need to construct context `ctx_init.m`
        * need to construct offline pair candidates: `offline_pair_candidates_2`


Current task: constructing offline pair candidates.  Command:

    data_2 = offline_pair_candidates_2(data_, params, 0, 1, 3);
