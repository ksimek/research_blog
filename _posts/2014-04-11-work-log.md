The following is an unedited set of notes from Friday's meeting. 

----


multiplexes

il-6 and Il-1 correlated with XXX.  Highest confidence

* TNF-\alpha bad correlation with XXX  - will it stand up?  lower confidence
    * Thad - harder to correlated with mind/body stimuli

* IFN \gamma - mostly out of range (low levels)

* Plates: 
    * some variability between plates.
    * same person always had same plate.
    * for each plate, we know what was the smallest readable value.
    * should we replace OOR< with plate minimum?
    * could we model it as a bound?

* properly report how immune markers correlate in our data?
    * Rebecca has ICC values.  

* Karen
    * IL-6 tends to increase as disease progresses
    * shouldn't occur in our subjects, because disease isn't progressing.
    * Some people had cancer return (12 died), so it might apply there.
    * IL-6 and TNF-alpha seem to be linked to mortality in breast cancer.

* Absolute inflamatory markers aren't clinically calibrated, but covariation may be explanatory.

* Th2 Th2?  Immune activation. ratio of Th1 and Th2 molecules.
    * see early part of karen's paper.

* Thad: Women being treated for health cancer are relatively healthy for 50 
    * most studies are in the context of extreme stress and .
    * radion and chemo may be 
        * we see IL-6, etc firing in the first or second visit after in these events.
    * hypothesis: high levels of markers could maybe lead to psychological issues later.
        * fatigue / depression relationship
    * turning on inflamatory stuff doesn't really help things.  Sometimes cancer thrives on it.
    * turning down inflamation before treatment can result in more effective radiotion treatment (karen: this is questionable)

* Can I get info on chemo treatment?  

* What variables do we care most about? 
    * time 
    * treatments
    * other biological?
    * have a partner?


* CENTER ON TREATMENT
    

* TNF alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 (in that order) you'd expect to see during cancer treatment
    * how long before observation did most recent treatment occur?


* Radiation duration: 1 month  (sampling point could come before or during)


* have chemo dates, but not radiation dates.
    * use "days since treatment" for chemo.
