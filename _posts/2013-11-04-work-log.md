First day after CVPR deadline.

Comp exam - committee, planning.

Computer issues - upgrade, crashing, keyboard?


2-Pass sampling.
==================

Evaluating the second likelihood term is still very slow, even after a 100x speedup.  

First do MH using single-term likelihood.  Then treat that as the proposal for the two-term likelihood.  Since the first step satisfies detailed balance, we have:
    
<div>
\[
\begin{align}
    \hat p(\theta) q(\theta' | \theta) &=
    \hat p(\theta') q(\theta | \theta') \\
    \frac{\hat p(\theta)}{\hat p(\theta')} &=
    \frac{q(\theta | \theta')}{q(\theta' | \theta)} 
\end{align}

\]
</div>

Where \\(\hat p(\theta)\\) is the surrogate posterior, using only the single-term likelihood.  Substituting this identity into the full MCMC acceptance term, we get:
    
<div>
\[
\begin{align}
\alpha &= \left \{ \frac{p(\theta') q(\theta | \theta')}{p(\theta)q(\theta' | \theta)}  \right \} \\
    &= \left \{ \frac{p(\theta') \hat p(\theta)}{p(\theta)\hat p(\theta')}  \right \} \\
    &= \frac{L_2(\theta')}{L_2(\theta)}
\end{align}
\]
</div>

This obviously isn't applicable for traditional gibbs sampling, but gibbs could be used for proposal, and MH used to accept/reject
