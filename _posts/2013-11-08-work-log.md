iPLant meeting
-------------------

Final document: start by talking about representation vs. "features" (characteristics).  Clarify "features", don't use indescriminitively (call them high-level features, topological features, as opposed to image features).

Two ways:
* "look directly for charactersitics/features"
* "look for model, find the other stuff"

i.e. looking for representations vs. characteristics

focus on 

split between bio literature and CV literature.


Deliverables
    * 
    * 

* Bisque vs. Nonbisque?
    * Interactive systems like Clark maybe not fit for Bisque.

**Taxonomy of curve-extraction**
*  3D vs 2D
* imaging system type
* temporal vs. nontemporal
* branching vs non branching
