iPLant meeting
-------------------

Final document: start by talking about representation vs. "features" (characteristics).  Clarify "features", don't use indescriminitively (call them high-level features, topological features, as opposed to image features).

Two ways:
* "look directly for charactersitics/features"
* "look for model, find the other stuff"

i.e. looking for representations vs. characteristics

focus on 

split between bio literature and CV literature.


Deliverables
    * 
    * 

* Bisque vs. Nonbisque?
    * Interactive systems like Clark maybe not fit for Bisque.

Taxonomy of curve-extraction
-----------------------------
Kobus mentioned the different "dimensions"  that the problem can be split into.  Some might be

* 3D vs 2D
* imaging system type
* temporal vs. nontemporal
* branching vs non branching
* biological vs. nonbiological
*  


Research Topics
-----------
Several topics to look into

**Image Processing**
* Medial axis filtering
* curve modelling (GP, 
* finding branches

**Applications**
* pollen tube tracking
* root tracking
* Blood vessel literature (vascular segmentation)
* Neuron tracing


Data Inventory 
---------------
We currently have data sets from a handful of different applications/domains.

* Pollen tubes
* "Clark" root image (2D, one image)
* "Max Plank" root images 
* Neurons
