Tested gradient and hessian -- is it correct with new model?  ... Yes.

Is index optimization working?  Quick test:  ran this code twice, once using analytical hessian, once with hessian-free algorithm:
    
    [mu_, Tracks_] = get_wacv_result(5, params_trained.model_type, 'deleteme_new2');
    out = optimize_ml_wrt_indices(Tracks_(14), [], data, params_trained);


Analytical method halts early -- can't improve.  Final gradient is noticibly non-zero

Hessian-free method seems very effective:

Perhaps the optimization is failing; let's run end-to-end with hessian-free algorithm.  It will be super slow, but if it gives better results, we may have our solution.

    [mu_, Tracks_] = get_wacv_result(5, params_trained.model_type, 'deleteme_new3');
