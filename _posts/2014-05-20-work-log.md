Appending radiation data to full data table
----------------------------------------
Ran into some issues needing refactoring when trying to add radiation date columns to fire_all.csv.  The work was slow-going, because the parsing code is so incredibly slow (2-3 minutes to read and write all the data).   I managed to speed it up slightly by skipping the missing data check when no missing keys are specified.

Some of the bugs fixed:

* Enumeration columns weren't catching misparse errors, thus, some misparsed columns weren't being caught.
* Enums fail to write correctly.
* Refactored to allow writing of enumation columns as text.
* Found and fixed bugs in handling missing data and case sensitivity.

Finally (!) merged and committed radiation columns into fire_all.csv.  Committed and write a summary for Warren



Analyzing cluster membership
--------------------
**Description**: Are the membership values output by our clustering code related to treatment type?  
**Method**: Modify preprocessing code to output a matlab struct instead of a text file.  Modify clustering code to output memberships as a text file instead of a color image.  Visualize both cluster membership and ground truth treatment type and compare.

**Results**:

<table class="data">
<tr><th>Treatment</th><th>p(cluster == 1 | treatment)</tr>
<tr><td>Overall</td><td>74.7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>None</td><td>95.5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Radiation only</td><td>44.0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chemotherapy only</td><td>73.9%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Both</td><td>85.2%</td></tr>
</table>
