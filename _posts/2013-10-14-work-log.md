Silhouettes are rendering badly

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2013-10-13-dump_0.png)

Looks like internal edges are rendering.  Likely an issue with shader_src/silhouette2.gs.glsl.

Need a quick way to tweak shader and re-run.

Building shader debugging mode
----------------------------

if enabled, results will display in viewer instead of being passed to likelihood.
