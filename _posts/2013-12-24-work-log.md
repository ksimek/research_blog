Testing constant-length energy function.  First test: \\(\eta\\) and it's Jacobian, implemented in `test/test_eta_deriv.m`.  Test passes.  Interesting observation: jacobian is nearly bidiagonal.  Hopefully the hessian will have similar form, so ignoring the off-diagonal terms won't be too detrimental.

Need to implement end-to-end test for \\(E\\) and its gradient/hessian.  Compare against analytical Hessian estimate and the crude \\(J'J\\) Hessian approximator.
