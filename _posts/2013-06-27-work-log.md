* Continued refactoring of likelihood
* C++ Bootcamp
* VR lab tour and new user set-up

Continued refactoring of likelihood
------------

Implemented "alternative approach" to handling tail points mentioned in last entry.  The old way didn't benefit from re-indexing; this way does.  This way handles negative index points correctly, too.

In process of testing and debugging.  Possibly more outcomes later tonight.

C++ Bootcamp
------------
today's session: inline and const-correctness

VR lab tour and new user set-up
------------
By Angus's request, I showed showed the new postdoc Javier around the lab and set him up with an admin account.  

Lots of things still broken on VR01; biggest problem is video card #2 not displaying anything.  Game controller not set up yet.    Showed osgviewer demo, and by Angus's request, got his Processing demo running too.
