Troubleshooting issues in "optimized" code in `curve_tree_ml_4`.

Biggest change was in how K, K_star, K_star_star were computed.
Comparing against the reference implementation `curve_tree_m_3` shows the "parent" indices aren't correct.

Solved.  When incorporating noise-free sampled values, was using indices and covariance from noisy observed values.

    Timing

    Old speed:    20.7 s
    New runtime:  75.7 s
    Speedup: 3.6x

Still rendering black.  why?

Apparently this is an issue with OSX's AMD driver -- geometry shaders fail after returning from sleep.  Restarting program solves it.
