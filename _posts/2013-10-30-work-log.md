Troubleshooting issues in "optimized" code in `curve_tree_ml_4`.

Biggest change was in how K, K_star, K_star_star were computed.
Comparing against the reference implementation `curve_tree_m_3` shows the "parent" indices aren't correct.

Solved.  When incorporating noise-free sampled values, was using indices and covariance from noisy observed values.

    Timing

    Old speed:    20.7 s
    New runtime:  75.7 s
    Speedup: 3.6x

Still rendering black.  why?

Apparently this is an issue with OSX's AMD driver -- geometry shaders fail after returning from sleep.  Restarting program solves it.

**Profiling v4**

Only 19 calls to `construct_attachment_covariance_3`, down from ~500.  

78% bottleneck in matrix multiplication / inversion

Nystrom (2x) on curves with dimension greater than 1000 brings bottlenect from 18s to 11s, but as before, results are highly sensitive to the nystrom factor and using it without careful tuning / heursitics is risky.
