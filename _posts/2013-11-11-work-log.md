iPlant Reading
----------------------

**Hypocotyl Tracing**

Read three papers on Hypocotyl tracing from plant biology.  Methods are mostly straighforward: threshold, extract curve using {distance transform, morphological skeleton, gaussian tracing}, terminate using hand-built criterion.

* Hypotrace, Want et al.
* HyDE, Cole et al.
* Miller et al.

**Root Tracing**

Read several papers on root tracing

* "RootRead3D" Clark  et al. 2011
    * Zhu 2006 - hough-transform / space carving to find voxels; skeletonize using "minumum cross section",  fit with NURBS curve.
    * "Smart-root" Lobet et. al 2011 - Most cited Clark descendant; Semi-auto, **2D**; hand-build algorithm, trace bright regions with consistent radius.  Seems tuned, nonrobust, relies on a strong GUI.  Naive?
        * "EZRhizo" Armengaud et al. 2009 - Manual tracing? (To Read)
        * "DART" Le Bot et al., 2010 - Manual Tracing? (To read)
        * Iyer-Pascuzzi et a., 2010 - Automatic.  Multiple angles, but **2D analysis**.  preprocess: Adaptive threshold.  Medial axis: distance transform
        * "Root-trace" Nadeem et al. 2009 - auto; (To Download)
    * Fang et al. 2009  - Laser scanner, skeleton using hough transform method.

** Neuron Analysis **

Reading papers of the [teams that won the Diadam Challenge](http://diademchallenge.org/algorithms.html) for tracing neurons.  It seems that image processing used in these papers far surpasses those in the plant biology I've read.  Likely due to (a) better imaging systems and (b) much more ambiguity to deal with.


**Wang et al. A Broadly Applicable 3-D Neuron Tracing Method Based on Open-Curve Snake**

Preprocessing: eigenanalysis of image hessian, eigenvalues are used to determine "vesselness" of each pixel.
Presegmentation: Graph cut.  Actually "Vessel Cut",
