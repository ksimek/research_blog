Spring Topics of Interest
-------------------------

*Active learning / Deep Learning*

* Active Learning of an Action Detector from Untrimmed Videos - Grauman
* A Convex Optimization Framework for Active Learning?
* ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (hinton)


Optimization (not mcmc)
------------------

e.g. "relaxation" methods

* Estimating the 3D Layout of Indoor Scenes and its Clutter from Depth Sensors
* Holistic Scene Understanding for 3D Object Detection with RGBD cameras

Scenes and captions
------------------

* From Large Scale Image Categorization to Entry-Level Categories - "best paper, iccv 2013"
* NEIL: Extracting Visual Knowledge from Web Data
* A Sentence is Worth a Thousand Pixels

Detection
-------------

* HOGgles: Visualizing Object Detection Features 
* Finding the Best from the Second Bests -- Inhibiting Subjective Bias in Evaluation of Visual Tracking Algorithms


Miscellaneous
----------------

* Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking - ian reid  (possibly of interest to Ernesto?)

* Relative Attributes For Large-scale Abandoned Object Detection (Quanfu and Prasad's paper) [pdf](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2013/papers/Fan_Relative_Attributes_for_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf)


Inferring “Dark Matter” and “Dark Energy” from Videos
