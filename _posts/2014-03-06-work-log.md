--------------------
Below are some random notes from the discussion.

Generally speaking, the eventual goal is growth curve that indicates whether subject is getting better or worse over time.  This might split into three time-regions with different dynamics:  pre-treatment, treatment, recovery. 

The population could be split into three groups: radiation, chemo, untreated;  start by picking one and modeling it (probably chemo is a good start).  For now, untreated participant will probably be left out until we have a better idea of what we're modeling.

Absolute elapsed time may be less interesting than relative progress through treatment (but need to investigate).  

Will probably want to synchronize sequential data on an event (e.g. first treatment), since the first visit holds no strong meaning.

**Immediate taks:**  Cluster trajectories using GMM with missing data. Use visit-number as time index, syncing on \(x \in\) {first-treatment, final treatment}.  Split into chemo and radiation groups and handle separately. Be smart about choosing dataset to minimize missing data.  Visualize by plotting single dimension, one curve per cluster.

Gathering data for clustering
-----------------------------

Emily says to use these datasets specifically for the first approach:

     ['sri3.csv', 'das4.csv', 'ea4.csv', 'fact4.csv', 'pss4.csv']

###SRI

Several redundant columns here.  Questions 4 and 5 ( "PartnerUpsetting4" and  "Conflicted5") are recoded as "repartnerupsetting4" and "reconflicted5", and then all columns are cloned into XXXn_conv, for n in {1,...,5}.  Thus, the relevant columns are:
    
    partnerimp1_conv
    partnerpredictable2_conv
    partnerhelpful3_conv	
    repartnerupsetting4_conv
    reconflicted5_conv

###DAS

Relevant columns:

    Affection1 
    Sex2
    Kiss3
    TooTired4
    ShowLove5

###EA

Relevant columns:

    FigureOut1
    Comfortable2
    GladPleased3
    Worthwhile4
    Cherish5
    AttendTo6
    Enjoy7
    Appreciate8
    LetGo9
    TakeCareOf10
    EnergyFigureOut11
    Like12
    InTouch13


###FACT

Relevant columns (all should be reversed)

    LackEnergy1
    Nausea2
    TrblMeetNeedsFam3
    HavePain4
    SideEffectsBother5
    FeelSick6
    TimeInBed7

###PSS

Like SRI, we used the recoded `*_conv` fields:

    upsetunexpectantly1_conv
    unabletocontrol2_conv
    stressed3_conv
    redealtwithhassles4_conv
    ineffectivecoping5_conv
    reconfidenthandleprob6_conv
    regoingyourway7_conv
    notcopewithall8_conv
    recontrolirritations9_conv
    reontopofthings10_conv

###Summary
    
Forty total dimensions.  

These datasets apply to everyone, and should have minimal missing data (30 total):

    PSS
    FACT
    EA

These datasets apply only to those in a relationship (10 total):
    
    DAS
    SRI


Take three approaches:
    
(1) look for nontemporal relationships among these dimensions (PCA).  Several of these dimensions may collapse into one.
(2) concatenate all visits into a vector and cluster (40 * 9 = 360 dimensional points)
(3) repeat (2) but re-center based on treatment date



Misc
----

999 nonempty records in the full 40-dimensional model.

651 records are missing-data-free in the full 40-dimensional model.

863 records are missing-data-free in the 30-dimensional relationship-free model.

TODO:  concatenate for approach (2) above, and re-evaluate coverage.

PCA
----

We didn't really expect PCA to give interesting results, but I ran it anyway.  Definitely no obvious clusters.

About 20 of the 40 dimensions seem relevant?
