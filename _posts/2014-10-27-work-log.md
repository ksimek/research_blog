The current mode for dynamics is a cubic spline spatial process modulated by a Weiner temporal process.  This is allowing excessive drift toward the cameras when curves are long.  A stationary covariance function should avoid this, but out model requires zero covariance at the start of a curve.  

To resolve this, we can condition the process to start at the origin.  

K - K:0 1/K0 K:0'

The equivalent covariance function is:
    
k_{x|x_0}(x,x') = k(x,x') - k(x, 0) 1/k(0,0) K(0,x')
    
When k(x,x') is a squared exponential, the conditional covariance function becomes

k_{x|x_0}(x,x') = k(x,x') \left (1 - exp\{(-x_i x_j)/s}\right)

This causes the covariance to start at zero, and smoothly transition to the standard kernel, over a time scale \(s\).  

Adding this as an option to the covariance function...

Misc notes
-------------

When computing ML, must try curves both forward and backward, since the covariance for dynamics is assymetrical.  Root motion is much more penalized than tip motion.
