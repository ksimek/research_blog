Structure Learning
---------------

The fact that we have a 500-dimensional dynamical system offers opportunities to learn high-dimensional relationships.  I spent some time looking into structure learning.  
**Variational Bayes**

[Zoubin Ghahramani slides on variational bayes](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin)

Variational EM could learn LDS with unknown structure or switching state space model. 

**Dirichlet Process**

Video: [Inferring structure from data](http://videolectures.net/mlss2010_griffiths_isfd/), Tom Griffiths, Cognitive Science and Machine Learning Summer School, 2010

Maybe could be used to learn LDS structure. Griffiths shows a noisy-or model with unknown dimension, using a Dirichlet process prior.  At its center is a rank-defficient matrix constructed from product of NxM and MxN matrices, where M < N.  Could use something similar to learn sparse dynamics matrix, but we're dealing with continuous-valued data rather than binary-valued.  If this can be done, there must be existing literature on it, will dig further.

**Parameter Learning**

This tech report from Ghahramani and Hinton derives the EM for learning LDS parameters and latent states jointly.  For the M step, they derive expressions for the full transition matrix, plus the system and observation noise covariance, and initial state.  For the E step, they use Kalman for forward estimation followed by a backward recursion.  We're more interested in a sparse representation of dynamics.

Modeling
------------
Kobus pointed out that the short time-frame means second-order dynamics likely won't emerge.
