Implementing one-object-per-view in likelihood_server

Overloaded bd_mv_likelihood' evaluate and dump  functions to receive a sequence of renderables.

Write a "wrap_all_As_silhouette" to, well, wrap all renderables in silhouette renderers.

re-wrote message-to-curve function to decode the message to a vector-vector-vector, and convert that to a vector-of-gl_curves.

Compiling work from last 24 hours.

Done.

--- 

1. Generate a multi-model message from matlab (dummy)
2. test message in likelihood_server_2.cpp
3. generate random samples from wacv data.
---

Doing dummy message test.

At first, accidentally sent to old implementation... and it didn't barf!  This is unsettling, because the message format has changed significantly.  Did I ever recompile the mex files?

Nope.  got some mex compile errors to deal with.

**Friday**

okay, sending a random model using the new one-per-view message system isn't crashing.

Questions

1. the likelihood looks high, considering it's a ranomd model .  is a null model better?  is the ground-truth model better?
2. visualize the received message;  is each view different?

Trying the null model from 1., the mex file crashed matlab.  Empty curvesset isn't handled.

trying all-zeros.  Server crashed -- coincident points aren't handled gracefully.  Fixed (now it returns -inf for log likelihood).

issues
server: error creating gl_curves causes client disconnect. fix exception handling
client: doesn't handle server crashes gracefully.  adding timeout
client: doesn't handle empty curveset

Next:

* random sample from multi-view posterior (instead of single max posterior)
* get likelihood from multiple samples -- what is the variance of the MC estimator?
