{% include JB/setup %}

  threshold
  distance transform
  skeleton
  identify chains, endpoints, and intersections
  identify endpoint merge candidates
  identify t-junction merge candidates

  identify ambiguous cases
    ambiguous intersection (which one is the lateral?)
    ambiguous merge (endpoint vs t-junction?

  for each skeleton point, 
    find direction and distance to two matching points
    get width

  identify soma as point with largest distance

  filter bad skeleton points
    average touch-point velocity is much less than skeleton point velocity.
    with changes almost as fast as skeleton point moves
    
  ———————————
  GROUND TRUTH
  ————————————

  w/ known skeleton
  ———————————
  identify skeleton points that are good/bad
  manually resolve junctions
  manually perform merges

  general
  ————
  Trace out general topology w/ bezier curves.
    

  ————————
  LEARNING
  ————————

  quantities of interest:

  GP parameters
    position changes
    width changes
    
  soma shape/size?


  GP MODELS

  smooth curve plus mean-reverting random walk?
    smooth curve resolves ambiguous branch using curvature


  ————————
  LIKELIHOOD
  —————

  Allow greater uncertainty along cross-section, because width doesn’t change symmetrically.

  Evidence is weaker where skeleton points are weak (i.e. width changes quickly)

  ———————
  INFERENCE
  —————

  Questions to answer:

  which skeleton sections are for actual dendrites? 


  —————
  STRAW MEN
  ——————

  1. Use all curves; no merging, use heuristics to resolve junctions
  2. same as 1. but use “weak curve” heuristic to trim bad cases
    train an svm to decide which curves are good?



  ———————
  Evaluation
  ———————

  general, weak
  ——————————
  number of curves
  number of lateral branches
  histogram of curve lengths

  general, strong
  ———————————
  topology evaluation / mot metrics - match to ground truth and count identity swaps, etc

  w/ GT against known skeleton
  ———————————————
  misclassified junctions
  false positive/false negative merges


  ——————
  misc
  ——————
  Is there any benefit to reconstructing the “smoothed” neuron?  probably not. but the latent model is still useful for classifying junctions.

  How do deal with un-ground-truthable junctions?

  how to deal with regions poorly modelled by a skeleton?

  I should look into neuron-tracing prior art.

  threshold issue:
    try multiple thresholds and somehow merge skeletons?


matlab code
-------------

  cd /Volumes/offload/Downloads/JT106_Ex33_Original
  img = imread('JT106_Ex33_61.tif');
  level = graythresh(img)
  I = img > (level * max(img(:)));
  D = bwdist(~I);
  skel = bwmorph(D,'skel',Inf);
  imagesc(skel)
  skel2 = bwmorph(D,'skel',5);
