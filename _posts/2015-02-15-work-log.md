{% include JB/setup %}

Finished porting and testing triangulation.  

Implemented single-view likelihood.  Derived and implemented likelihood graident; used it (and the existing hessian implementation) to fit degenerate Gaussian w/ Newton's method.

Finished kalman filter for tracking trees.  Getting weird results; need to debug tomorrow.
