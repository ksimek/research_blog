Monday IVILAB infrastructure meeting
=======================================
I'll be organizing the Computational Intelligence seminar this semester.

Will need to

* Arrange volunteers
* send announcements
* send reminders to speakers
* Set up seminar web page


Building efficient curve-tree ML.
==================================

Significant rework.

New field: branch_K and branch_mu to store mean and covariance of all points in curve.
Prior_k now does not include offset covariance; stored in branch_K.
mu_b and Sigma_b now store the branch point means and covariances for all views

fix kernel to not include offset index

Issues
========

Finished implementation.  Has bugs.

Start-point has no effect
-------------------------

Example:

    start_pt = [0 100];
    ml = [];
    for i = 1:2
        Corrs = attach(Corrs, 2, 1, start_pt(i), 0, params);
        ml(i) = curve_tree_ml_2(Corrs, params, data_);
    end
    assert(ml(1) == ml(2));

*Fixed* - stupid bug in `attachment/attach.m` - was index offset was hard-coded to zero due to a refactoring mishap.

Optimal Branch point isn't correct
---------------------------------

Example:

    start_pt = [0 10 50 100 1000 5000];
    ml = [];
    for i = 1:2
        Corrs = attach(Corrs, 2, 1, start_pt(i), 0, params);
        ml(i) = curve_tree_ml_2(Corrs, params, data_);
    end
    assert(all(diff(ml) > 0);

*Solved* - curves were reversed.

Handling reversed curves
========================

Should add a `reversed` flag, which reverses indices before building likelihood and prior.  currently, constructing the likelihood occurs during the "backproject and re-index" phase, in file `correspondence/corr_to_likelihood.m`.  Should refactor likelihood construction into its own function, so we don't have to re-backproject when we don't need to. 

Let's review the data-flow so we can see more clearly where everything happens.


Overview: end-to-end curve construction
========================================

1. propose association and attachment
    * By sampling (no code yet)
    * `train/labels_from_ground_truth` - propose from ground truth.
    * **Output**: assoc {}
2. Construct track
    * `correspondence/make_correspondence`
    * **Output**: Corrs {};  Corr.ml_2d
3. Correspondence and triangulation
    * `correspondence/build_full_correspondence.m` - build from scratch
    * `correspondence/merge_correspondence_2.m` - merge two pieces
    * **Output**: `corr`, `means`, `precisions`, `cov_error`
4. backproject and estimate curvature
    * `correspondence/corr_to_likelihood.m` - 
    * **Output**: `ll_{means, precisions, indices}`, `curve_sm*`
5. construct likelihood (flatten, sort, and reverse if needed)
    * `correspondence/flatten_sort_and_reverse.m` - (doesn't exist yet)
    * **Output**: `ll_{means_flat, precisions_flat, indices_flat, S}`
6. handle attachment recursively
    1. compute conditional prior
        * `attachment/att_set_start_index.m`
        * **Output**: `start_index`, `prior_K`, `prior_indices`
    2. compute branch point posterior
        * `attachment/att_set_branch_index.m`
        * **Output**: `branch_index`, `mu_b`, `sigma_b`, `branch_K`, `branch_mu`
7. Compute (ML, argmax, etc)

Consider renaming step 4.  backproject against rough triangulation; estimate curvature at each point; determine index set.  At this point, the order of points don't matter, because the index set hasn't been put to use.  


**Action: reverse curve** - detach?, rerun step 5, 6.1 & 6.2 on self, update branch point & rerun 6.2 for children.

Test: optimize branch point and start index
============================================

(TODO)


TODO
======
* optimize test
* get attachment, reversal, and branch points from ground truth
* store `ml_2d` with corr.  update on merge.  use during ml computation instead of data_
