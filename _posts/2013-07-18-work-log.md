Today:  

* Bootcamp demo session
* Ground truth labeling of curve fragments.

Bootcamp demo session
----------------------

Ran bootcamp demo session.  Final code available at

    svn+ssh://v01/misc/svn/src/bootcamp/kjb_demos/3d_demo

Ground truth labeling of curve fragments
=============

Goal: use 2D ground truth to automatically label bottom-up curve fragments.

Overview
------------

1. Draw ground truth curves using curve index
2. dilate slightly
3. For each rendered data curve, gather all GT indices
4. keep most-occurring GT index.
5. add to assoc list for that curve


Issues:
---------

**Q:** Remember how to read and process ground truth.  
**A:** See `../ground_truth/read_gt2.m`

Symlinked to `train/read_gt2.m`.

**Q:** Which dataset does our example data come from?  
**A:** `~/data/arabidopsis/2010-06-03/ler_5_36/ler_5_36_0.jpg`


**Q:** Where is ground truth data?  
**A:** `~/data/arabidopsis/2010-06-03/ler_5_36/resized_50%/ground_truth_2d.gt2`

Blah Blah
------------

Refactored some code into new function `build_curve_maps.m`, which renders each of the curves in a cell-array into a map containing their indices.

Forgot that GT is stored as Bezier curves.  Symlinked the all bezier-related code into data_association_2.  Relevant function is `bezier/polybez_to_polyline.m`.

Forgot that GT is stored in OpenGL-style coordinates (bottom-left origin).  Converting to top-right using `tools/flip_y.m`.

Summary 
---------

Got through item 2 in "Overview" above.  Will finish next time, and start building training framework.
