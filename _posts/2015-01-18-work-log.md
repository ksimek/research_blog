Implemented a image-pyramid-based likelihood and results are much better!  Also relaxed the prior, which appears to be overfit.  

Run 1:
-----------

* *parameterization*: eigenspace, scaled by sqrt of eigenvalues
* *Eigenvectors:* 30
* *Prior scaling:* 36
* *Algorithm*: pattern-search in two passes
** *termination criteria*: mesh size < 0.5 (roughly 1/2 pixel change)
** *First pass*: Ran until convergence at pyramid level 3 (i.e. 1/4th original size)
** *Second pass*: Ran until convergence at pyramid level 1


After first pass, the global maximum seemed to have been found.  The second pass quickly refined it.  

This wasn't happening with the trained prior, which 

Possible changes to consider
------------------------

Try using fewer eigenvectors. 

Use likelihood mixture rather than product.  Should be smoother and allow more non-optimal results.

Consider scaling by inverse of eigenvector dynamic range, so moving by 1 guarantees at least one pixel changing.

Consider using hyperpriors during training.

Train cubic spline covariance model.
