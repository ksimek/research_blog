Continuing along the inspiration from the yesterday's Pascal Fua paper investigating length constraint terms for index optimization.

It's difficult, because length implies known structure, which in turn implies known indices.  So constraining indices based on length feels like a circular argument.  This has been a sticking point in my thinking for a long time.  But we can formulate this in terms of expectations, namely, given an index set, the *expected segment length* should be equal to difference of their indices.

Let \\( L_i = \|x_i - x_{i-1}\| \\) be the distance between points with adjacent indices. 

Expected length given and index set, \\(t\\) is:

<div>
\[
\begin{align}
\mathrm{E}[L_i] &= \mathrm{E}[\| x_i - x_{i-1}\|^2] \\
                &= \mathrm{E}[x_i^2 - 2 x_i x_{i-1} + x_{i-1}^2 ] \\
                &= \mathrm{E}[x_i^2] - 2 \mathrm{E}[x_i x_{i-1}] + \mathrm{E}[x_{i-1}^2 ] \\
                &= \left( \mathrm{Cov}[x_i]  + \left( \mathrm{E}[x_i] \right) \right) - 2 \left( \mathrm{Cov}[x_i, x_{i-1}] + \mathrm{E}[x_i]\mathrm{E}[x_{i-1}] \right) + \left( \mathrm{Cov}[x_{i-1}]  + \left( \mathrm{E}[x_{i-1}] \right) \right)\\
                &= \left(k(x_i,x_i) + k(x_{i-1}, x_{i-1} - 2 k(x_i, x_{i-1}) \right) + \left( \mu_i^2 + \mu_{i-1}^2 - 2 \mu_i \mu_{i-1} \right)\\
                &= D K_i D^\top + (D \mu_{i,i-1})^\top D \mu_{i,i-1}
\end{align}
\]
</div>

Where D is the differencing matrix, \\(D = (1, -1)\\).
Observe that each dimension is independent in the squared distance equation, so we can treat each dimension separately in the equation above.
