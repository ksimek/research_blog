Must do ransac, 15 minutes will do.

Testing hessian formulae
---------------------------

Realized I got the formula for \\(\frac{\partial \delta_i}{\partial x_j}\\) wrong for the case where \\(i == j\\).  It's actually a dense vector, not a sparse one, which changes all of my computations.  Should only affect on-diagonal elements of the hessian.
