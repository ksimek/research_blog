Addressing issues that came up last time we ran WACV.  

Currently working on dataset #8, which has some real problems.

Spent some time tweaking the ground truth, adding missing curves, and correcting one or two obvious mistakes.

Still getting terrible results; one problem might be the "rough" reconstruction, which doesn't take into account anisotropic data uncertainty.  Fixed.

False-positive reversal has been corrected, but still getting terrible results; it seems like the camera calibration is waaaay off.  

I dont have the calibration data for this dataset available, locally re-syncing full dataset.

Are these calibrated cameras ordered in counter-clockwise direction?
