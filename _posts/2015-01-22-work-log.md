Next up: finding trees in single image.

* User specifies number of branches
* Prior over branch width in pixels
* Weak prior over length (with hard bounds) 
* Don't do anything clever

Tasks
------
* Train new likelihood forcing curves to be constant-width.
* Generate proposals from skeletonized foreground.
* Optimize likelihood of proposal by extending/shortening.
* Extend, find MAP, estimate ML
** Assume isotropic likelihood hessian
** Known prior hessian
** Laplace approximation

Skeleton to proposal
---------------------
* pick long chains (weight by length).  Extend by connecting chains if below angle threshold
* convert to medial axis form, place in image

Evaluate proposal
----------------
* optimize posterior
* compute ml
* maximize ml by repeatedly extending, optimizing, computing ml
* maximize ml by repeatedly shortening, optimizing, computing ml

propose branching
-------------------
* optimize Laplace-approximated ml over  (a) branch distance; (b) branch position
