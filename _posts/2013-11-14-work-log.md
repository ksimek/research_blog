Resuming debugging of analytical gradient.

I noted yesterday that the error we observed in K' was small -- on the order of 1e-5 -- implying that it wasn't sufficient to explain the end-to-end error we're seeing.  But we should put that into context.  The delta from the numerical gradient is 1e-7, so the error in K' is around 1%, i.e. in the noticible range.

Today's strategy: implement a legitimate test-bed that we can run for several deltas and get all intermediate values for both numeric and analytical gradient.
