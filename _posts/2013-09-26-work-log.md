Problem with revamped index-estimation code:  it fails miserably on poorly-triangulatable hypotheses.  

The heuristic triangulation explodes in size, probably because triangulated points are all over the map (need to confirm this).

Adding error codes; if any part of the pipeline can't complete for any reason, set error code and return.  On error, the MCMC move will simply reject the proposal.

Issue with `build_full_correspondence`: input track is destroyed and replaced.

Refactored to replace make_correspondence with init_track.

    make_correspondence -> init_track
    make_trivial_correspondence -> init_trivial_corespondence

Running `offline_pair_candidates_2`.  Seems to be running without crashing.

Takes about 10 minutes;  seems fast considering all the new logic we've added (re-triangulation, 2D DTW). Probably the mex'd DTW is helping.  Some profiling will likely identify some low-hanging optimization fruit here, too.

Need to inspect triangulated curves when done.

Need to see if background subtraction classifier will help prune.

Oops, spoke too soon.  Crash at about 75% completion.

Random bug in candidate-proposal generator.  wasn't handling the "no candidates" case, resulted in index-out-of-bounds error.
