Late-hour realization: not sure how to handle attachment matrix when multiple-views are allowed.  Deriving the correct equations will take all afternoon; no time.  Decided to remove the tracking part from the paper.


Reconstructions
======================

code in `wacv-2012/run_wacv.m`.  Example call:
    
    gt_paths = arrayfun(@(x) sprintf('wacv-2012/datasets/%d', x), 1:11, 'UniformOutput', false);
    gt_cam_fmt = [gt_paths{i} '/cal/calib_%d.txt'];
    gt_fname = [gt_paths{i} '/ground_truth_2d.gt2'];
    [mu, lengths] = run_wacv(gt_fname, gt_cam_fmt, 1:4:36, [397,530]', params, 1);
    mu = reshape(mu, 3, []);
    mu = mat2cell(mu, 3, lengths);
    colors = lines(numel(mu));
    for i = 1:numel(mu);
        c = mu{i};
        col = colors(i, :);
        plot3(c(1,:), c(2,:), c(3,:), '-o', 'Color', col);
        hold on
    end

Results
----------

*Dataset #1*: curve #1 has some weird shape.  Probably and error in GT

*Dataset #2*: again weirdness in curve #1.  Now I'm guessing it's an attachment issue:

![bad result]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2013-09-05-bad_result_c2_pass1.png)

Run again without attachments.

*Dataset #2*: curve 1 issue is better; now exhibiting some weird stray points.  few views, bad indices?

![result 2]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2013-09-05-c2-pass2.png)

It looks like the base curves are trying to attach to the *end* of curve #1, instead of the beginning.
