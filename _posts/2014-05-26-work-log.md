Run: Refactoring kmeans, fixed bug
--------------
**Description**: Refactored k-means to make replicates easier to run.  Also fixed a bug in how collapsed clusters are handled.
**Results**:  

    BEFORE REPOPULATION FIX

        10 itns
        ----------
        training error: 3.61348
        test error: 4.60147

        15 itns
        --------
        training error: 3.60094

    AFTER REPOPULATION FIX

        10 itns
        ---------
        training error: 3.5833
        test error: 4.57327

        15 itns
        ---------
        training error: 3.58389
        test error: 4.57315

        20 itns
        ---------
        training error: 3.58411
        test error: 4.57321

**Discussion**: 

Neither of these results match what I was getting on Friday.  Testing error in particular is worse.  Did I break something?

Found it:  error in evaluation code arising from bad copy/paste.

Another issue:  should be using centered_data.txt, not data.txt.   

Run: multiple repetitions
-------
**Description**: Run kmeans with 10 repetitions.  
**Issues**:  

* Found assert failure - fixing empty clusters sometimes fails.  
* only fixed empty clusters after first iteration.  fixed  
* fails when same cluster is picked twice.  fixed
* cluster weights was computed wrongly.

**Results**: 

    trivial model error: 3.55057

    10 itns
    -------
    training error: 3.54682
    test error: 4.51326

    training error: 3.53998
    test error: 4.52958

Training and teesting error improve over the single-initialization version.  Test error is slightly worse for 20-iteration run; possibly due to overfitting.

Run: New baseline - use centered data
-------
**Description**: Perform 10 replicates of k-means using centered log-transformed data.

    Trivial model error: 1.40502

    10 itns
    -----------
    training error: 1.10196
    test error: 1.11679
    
    15 itns
    ----------
    training error: 1.09979
    test error: 1.09903

    20 itns
    --------------
    training error: 1.09756
    test error: 1.09137

Run: compare against null model
---------------------------
**Description**: Do we do better or worse with a constant model? (slope zero, intercept zero)
**Results**: see previous runs; "trivial model" results have been added.

**Discussion**:  
It is interesting that the trivial model performs better on raw data than the cluster model.  With rescaled data, the cluster model performs better.

Run: continuous model (aborted)
--------------------
**Description**: Re-run using the continuous model.
**Details**: 

* Found bug in line-fitting corner case.  Fails if all observations occur at same time.
* found huge bug in preprocessing -- all values are identical!  Was an indexing error introduced when we added per-plate centering.

Will need to re-run all experiments.

Run: baseline (rerun)
--------------------
**Description**: Re-run baseline fitting of centered data using discontinuous model.  10 Repetitions

**Results**: 


    Trivial model error: 1.58913
    Single cluster error: 1.58365
    training error: 1.61625
    test error: 1.64005

**Discussion**: trivial model outperforms clustered model.  This shouldn't be happening, need to investigate.
