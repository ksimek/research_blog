Run: Refactoring kmeans, fixed bug
--------------
**Description**: Refactored k-means to make replicates easier to run.  Also fixed a bug in how collapsed clusters are handled.
**Results**:  

    BEFORE REPOPULATION FIX

        10 itns
        -----------
        training error: -3.61348
        test error: -4.60147

        15 itns
        ---------
        training error: -3.60094
        test error: -4.58815

    AFTER REPOPULATION FIX

        10 itns

        test error: -4.57327

        test error: -4.57321

**Discussion**: 

Neither of these results match what I was getting on Friday.  Testing error in particular is worse.  Did I break something?

Found it:  error in evaluation code arising from bad copy/paste.

Another issue:  should be using centered_data.txt, not data.txt.   

Run: multiple repetitions
-------
**Description**: Run kmeans with 10 repetitions
**Issues**:  Found assert failure - fixing empty clusters sometimes fails.

Run: New baseline - use centered data
-------

Anomaly:  Subject 575116
-----------------------

The IL-8 readings of subject 575116 are incredibly high.  As a result, it can't be fit in any cluster, and it is always picked when a candidate is needed for a new cluster.  This behavior should improve when we switch to log-transformed centered data, but it may be interesting to study subject 575116 in more detail.

Received a lumpectomy, no chemo

At visit 4, her status changed from NED to "New Primary" which is very uncommon

The rad_supl dataset shows Subject 575116 received two passes of radiation.

At age 72, she is on the high end of the age range.

Very good FACT numbers, (low energy and a few side effects, but all low-level)
