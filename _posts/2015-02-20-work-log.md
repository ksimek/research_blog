Today: continue refactor, pipeline building

Queue:
-----------

* Investigate 2d curve finding bug
* 2D evaluation
* investigate "zero covariance" bug
* Extend to third view

Later
--------- 

* Third view
** Project 3D estimate into 2d
** grow/shrink curves
** add/break branches


Pipeline tasks
---------------
* move logic from tmp_track_all to a function
* write pipeline script - all input/output in one directory
* write intermediate output at each stage
** curve extraction
** branch estimation
** warping
** likelihood estimate
** pair-wise 3d reconstruction
** 3rd-view warping
** likelihood estimate
** 3-view reconstruction
** ...
** nth view warping
** n-th view reconstruction

For each view, keep likelihood estimate
