Refactored kjb::Matrix::resize to be re-use allocated space under more circumstances.  This is currently a bottleneck in inference, and signficantly improves runtime.

Implemented Missing data handling:
    
1. Likelihood ignores missing values
2. initial model estimation handles gracefully handles missing data

TODO:  Test missing data.  Randomly convert observations to missing, see if cluster parameters and memberships are still correctly estimated.  Is there a "critical point" above which missing data ruins results?
