Software
===========

ImageJ 
-----------
ImageJ has great image stack tools (slicing, manipulation, analysis).  Has the "tubeness" measure from the diadem challenge.

ImageJ Cookbook
----------------
The "[cookbook](http://fiji.sc/Cookbook)" plugin for microscopy seems to be very useful in particular.

MBF Plugin Collection
---------------------------
The original software associated with the "ImageJ for Microscopy" reference (see below).  It seems defunct now, and is supplanted by the ImageJ Cookbook plugin suite.

Neuromantic
------------

Need to look into this tool.  Was mentioned in Diadem data documentation.

[link](http://www.reading.ac.uk/neuromantic/)

[pdf](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fninf.2012.00004/abstract)

count: 3

Xvoxtrace
-----------

Manual segmentation tool

Synu
----

Surface reconstruct tool (used with Xvoxtrace?)

Neurolucida
------------

Segmentation tool.  Provides nice single-line segmentations, rather than the volumetric ones from other tools.

Extension: *.asc (ascii)

Count: 5

Analyze (7.5)
------------------

Image stack tool?  Compressed image stacks

extension: *.img, *.hdr

Amira
------

Semi-automatic segmentation

BioRadPIC
------------
microscopy image data format

extension: *.PIC

flNeuronTool
-------------
Neuron Tracing tool (C++)

cvapp - Duke / Southampton Morphology editor
--------------------------------------------

Neuron tracing, labelling.  Can read neurolucida files.

Vaa3D 
-------
[link](http://vaa3d.org)

NeuronStudio
------------
[link](http://research.mssm.edu/cnic/tools-ns.html)

Rayburst
-----------

Algorithm used in at least one tracing algorithm.

[link](http://research.mssm.edu/cnic/tools-rayburst.html)

Neurozoom
-----------

TBD

NeuronML
-------------

[link](http://www.neuroml.org/tool_support)

open format for representing neurons, neuron networks, and others.

NeuronLand 
---------

convert between over 20 difference neuron morphology formats

Neuron Datasets
===============

NeuroMorpho
----------------------------

Seems to be an open neuron reconstruction dataset.  They don't appear to have the original images, unfortunatley.  I could try to contact the labs

[link](http://neuromorpho.org/neuroMorpho/index.jsp)

Duke Southampton Archive of Neuronal Morphology
-------------------------

Cell-centered database
----------------------

General database of cell images.  

[link](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/CCDBWebSite/index.html)

#### Useful search terms:

* Neuron (obviously)
* Dendritic tree
* Spiny Dendrite
* Purkinje
* neurolucida (ground truth tool)
* vascular?  
* protoplasmic astrocyte
* cerebellar basket cell

#### Examined datasets

* [dendritic tree](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=1&event=displaySum) - could be good for "tracking" through slices.  Ground truth segmentation isn't clear
* [spiny dendrite](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=12&event=displaySum) - 
* [Purkinje neuron (dendritic tree)](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=2&event=displaySum) - very complex branching structure, with ground truth
* [Purkinje neuron (spiny dendrite)](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=3494&event=displayRecon) - nice electron microscopy image
* [Purkinje neuron (multiphoton)](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=3687&event=displaySum)  Nice but no ground truth
* (http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=3380&event=displaySeg) - confocal data seems in the seetspot between clean and noisy.  Nice 3d ground truth
* [medium spiny neuron (transmitted light](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=3693&event=displaySeg) - has a nice looking ground-truth
* [neocortex pyramidal neuron](http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/sand/main?mpid=8244&event=displayRecon) - different-looking neuron, different lab, could be an easier dataset

#### Datasets to look into

* Maryann Martone - at least 4 very complex dendritic tree stacks w/ ground truth.
* Mark Ellisman, Stephen Larson - at least 1 full neuron w/ semi-auto segmentation

#### Data types

* confocal
* IVEM / UHVEM - {intermediate, ultra high} voltage electron microscopy)
* transmitted light
* multiphoton - very clean images

Miscellaneous
====================

* Lucifer yellow - cell stain
* Golgi - staining method
* genesis modelling package?


To Try
==========

* Decovolution with synthetic and emperical point spread functions.
* using duke/southampton format - swc
* use neuromorpho for training 
** experimental condition: "Control"
