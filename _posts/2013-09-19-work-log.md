TODO
===

* investigate difference between ML implementations
* handle nonzero start-index in branching. re-run confirmation
* ground truth - trace datasets 7 through 10
* retrain using attachment

Invstigating consistent ML implementations
==========================

Discovered issue:  was calling `curve_tree_ml` instead of `curve_tree_ml_2`.  Working now

Aside: common mistakeis
----------------

Losing a too much time to stupid organizational mistakes --

* indexing, 
* passing wrong copies of variables to code, 
* leaving random debugging code in miscellaneous functions, 
* running wrong debugging branch in code,
* running wrong version of function.

Code has gotten complex enough that managing all of these little sharp edges is too expensive.  Need to start being more disciplined.  Solutions

* **indexing**: use functions for common indexing tasks
    * `one_d_to_three_d`
    * `to_block_index`
* **miscellaneous variables**: clean-up workspace every evening
* **Debugging cruft**: 
    * if code is an in-line test, refactor questionable code into functions; write a real test.
    * if code is a `plot`, `imagesc`, or `printf`, always wrap in a DEBUGGING block, even if its a two-minute test.
* **Wrong debugging branch**: 
    * if using `method = 1` give names like `method = MARKOV`
    * display warnings for non-standard methods.
* **wrong version of function**: depends on future of old code
    * **deprecation**: add block to old reference code: `fprintf('running legacy code (press enter)'); pause;`
    * **reference implementation**: rename to *_ref.


Discussion: start_index and branch_index
==================

In previous days, I was torn over whether I should add start_index to branch_index before evaluating.

The answer is yes, because it greatly simplifies the optimization of start_index, because you don't have to re-adjust the children's branch_indices.  

    
how is markov blanket determined (pre or post offset indexing?)

Do we need to recurse after attach?

RAW VALUES should be stored, not derived values.  branch_index is a raw value.  

*Example: * C is attached to B.  We want to attach B to A, with start index of 10.  Assume branch_index is stored relative to the zero-index (as opposed to the first observed point).  After attaching, we need to update C's branch point; if we later detach B from A, B's branch point need to be updated again.  There's potential for drift to accumulate after all of these upates.  

To avoid confusion, replace branch_index to branch_distance; will convert to an index value before computing. Also `prior_indices` needs updating?  Or just eliminate


recursive Updating after attachment
----------------------------

Consider attachment:

Before

    (D -> C -> B)    (A)

After

    (D -> C -> B -> A) 

Visually,

                 A   B C D         A B C D 
                 |   | | |         | | | |
                 |   | |/          | | |/
                 |   | +           | | +  
                 |   |/            | |/ 
                 |   +       ==>   | +
                 |                 |/         
                 |                 +      

* After attaching B to A,  
    * C's branch index changes, so...
        * C's branch distribution changes, so...
            * D's branch distribution changes so...
                * D's ML changes
            * C's ML changes.
        * C's prior_K doesnt change.

As far as stored fields go, it looks like branch distributions change recursively after attachment, etc.

Dependencies
============

Did some thinking about dependencies; what needs to be updated when parents are changed.  Scan of the notes are available below.  Also did [a reference writeup]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/2013/09/19/dependencies/).

[Dependency hand-written notes]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2013-09-19-dependency_notes.jpg)

Refactoring
=============

Changed `Corr.branch_index` to `Corr.branch_distance`.

Replaced all instances of `Corrs(i).branch_index` with `get_branch_index(Corrs, i)`.

Replaced Corr.ll_indices* with Corr.ll_distances.

removed Corr.prior_indices

TODO: replace kernel(XX,YY) with eval_kernel(asdf)
    see att_set_start_index_2
TODO: replace Corrs cell array with Corrs structure array
