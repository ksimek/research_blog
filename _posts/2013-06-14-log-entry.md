Working on foreground curve model.

Begin of significant rework; SVN revision noted in infobox.

Editing  `correspondence/clean_correspondence2.m` which will replace `correspondence/clean_corespondence.m`.  Drawing partially from `corr_to_bg_likelihood.m`, esp. for "best match" logic.  

Probably will rename `correspondence/clean_correspondence2.m` to `correspondence/corr_to_likelihood.m` before I finish.

Will use `tests/test_ml_end_to_end` to compare old and new implementations.

Work still in progress...
