Debugging split/merge toy sampler. 

Split from 5 to 6 groups:

     split_alpha = -p_merge + p_split - q_split + q_merge - log(psplitmv) + log(0.5);
     K>> p_merge

     p_merge =

       -1.4437e+03

- -1.4437e+03 + -1.6060e+03 - -125.6828 + -2.7081

       K>> p_split

       p_split =

         -1.6060e+03

         K>> q_split

         q_split =

          -125.6828

          K>> q_merge

          q_merge =

             -2.7081

             K>> log(psplitmv)

        ans =

           -0.6931

           K>> log(0.5)

        ans =

           -0.6931

           K>> 

Merge from 6 to 5 groups:

    merge_alpha = p_merge - p_split + q_split - q_merge - pmergemv + psplitmv ;
    K>> p_merge

    p_merge =

      -1.4437e+03

    K>> p_split

    p_split =

      -1.6060e+03

    K>> q_split

    q_split =

     -208.8604

    K>> q_merge

    q_merge =

       -2.7081

    K>> pmergemv

    pmergemv =

       -0.6931

    K>> psplitmv

    psplitmv =

       -0.6931


Note that q_split doesn't match between the two moves.

After reflection, this shouldn't match, because we're comparing two different cases.  Specifically, the post-split results in two small groups, where as the pre-merge model has 6 groups of equal size.  Smaller groups have smaller number of ways to split, so the proposal probability is higher.

Killed myself today thinking about this problem and getting exactly nowhere.
