<div>
Building reference version of `build_attachment_covariance()`.  It does full recursion for every element, taking \(O(n^2 \log n)\) time.
</div>

---

Running now with model_type = 1;  estimated runtime: 45 minutes.  (compare this to less than 5 seconds in the fast version).

---

Results don't match.

Issue 1: topology indices array was reversed; handled inheritance wrongly.
Issue 2: forgot about start_index; should add to all curve indices.

Results now match when model type = 1.

---

Matching results suggest that the covariance matrix is correctly implemented as designed, but why are we getting negative eigenvalues?

---

Next: re-run with model_type = 3.
