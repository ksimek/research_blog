troubleshooting curve tracing.

Open issues:
* penalty for two overlapping curves isn't working
* some curves are rendered with gaps

The overlapping curve penalty is because we're computing the full likelihod wrongly.  

It isn't totally clear that maximum marginal likelihood is giving any benefit over maximum posterior.

TODO:
--------
* retrain foreground classifier - train stems and leafs independently
* convert pyramid from product to mixture
* after each extension, optimize in second view, too
