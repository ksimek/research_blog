Implementing index optimization.

Updating reference post on ML gradient to reflect new derivation that formulates gradient as a matrix multiplication.

Diversion: updating Ruby
-------------------------

Struggling with blog engine, need to upate rdiscount to get new feature, but gem install fails because gcc-4.2 is missing since upgrading to Mavericks.  Need to recompile/reinstall ruby, so the gem system uses clang.  `rvm xxx instal` is failing, because gcc-4.2 is missing.  Forcing clang; building causes segfault. Research says upgrade to HEAd of rvm, install ruby 2.0.0.  Tried, but still segfaulting... out of ideas.

New plan: install gcc-4.2 manually.  Luckilly homebrew has it in the repo.
