Implementing index optimization.

Main accopmlishment of the day: Derived an approach for finding the entire gradient with a single matrix multiplication.  Added this to [reference post on ML gradient]({{site.baseurl}}/2013/11/10/reference).

Diversion: updating Ruby
-------------------------

Struggling with blog engine, need to upate rdiscount to get new feature, but gem install fails because gcc-4.2 is missing since upgrading to Mavericks.  Need to recompile/reinstall ruby, so the gem system uses clang.  `rvm xxx instal` is failing, because gcc-4.2 is missing.  Forcing clang; building causes segfault. Research says upgrade to HEAd of rvm, install ruby 2.0.0.  Tried, but still segfaulting... out of ideas.

New plan: install gcc-4.2 manually.  Luckilly homebrew has it in the repo.

After some struggle, just gave up.  Annoyed at having wasted over an hour on this.
