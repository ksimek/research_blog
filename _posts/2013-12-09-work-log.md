Training hyperprior over indices vs. observation ordinal.

Struggling with modeling offset and rate.  Mean is usually zero, but not in this case.  Don't really care about initial conditions for now (and struggling with learning it anyway), so just learn smoothing sigma and set offset and rate covariance to large.

Reading more on GP Latent Variable Models.

[1] N. D. Lawrence and A. J. Moore, “Hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable models,” presented at the ICML '07: Proceedings of the 24th international conference on Machine learning, 2007.

At once similar and different from what we're doing.  In some sense, the index is a latent variable, but we aren't using latent variables as a dimension reduction technique, as is the crux of the GPLVM approach.

All these papers assume we can match keypoints of some patches, which isn't the case in our problem since our curves don't have distinctive texture.  However, I can draw inspiration from [1], in which several interesting energy functions are constructed as homogeneous linear equations and with linear constraints.  In one formulation, the normal posterior energy is supplemented with extra terms that prevent edge-lengths from changing.  In another formulation, the rigidity constraint is replaced with an inequality that prevents extension but disallows contraction, which permits sharp folds.

There are significant differences in our case.  First, we don't have a reference structure to compare the model against, so we don't know the reference length of each segment.  Second, this assumes known correspondences, which we don't have.  But we can use the idea of adding an energy term based on length.  

Reference [2] uses GPLVM (Gaussian process latent variable model) to model local deformations.  The latent variable formulation allows for nonlinear deformations (e.g. kinks, creases).  On the downside, it's nonconvex, so is best suited for tracking only.
