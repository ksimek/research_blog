### Q: how to align data?
David - align by first treatment

Emily - end point is also interesting - release point

Emily - Three most interesting time-syncs:  line up at first,  line up at last, line up since diagnosis

Rebecca - Surgery date? (diagnosis date could be a proxy for this)

Question for karen:  if surgery, when did it happen?

David:  what is being studied?  adjustment to diagnonis, or adjustment to treatment?




### Rebecca plots

* refacttot over time by treatment group


### Ambivalence

This idea of ambivalence seems to be an interesting avenue of study.  The main idea is having high "helpfulness" and high "upsetting" indicates an "ambivalent" relationship;  there seems to be much variability between how these two variables covary, may cluster well.

* Dataset: SRI
* we see evidence of this in our data
* how do these dimensions track over time?  (this would be novel)
	
Different dynamics of interest:
    
* healthy: float low vs flat high
* healthy: one doesn’t affect the other much.
* uncertain:  okay but wobbly, and connected
* unhealthy:  high "upsetting" but low "helpfulness"

**Experiment**: can ambivalence (sri) model predict "health"?

* health could be measured by physical functioning (fact), or stress (pss) 

Next steps
-----------
Investigae ambivalence as a two-dimensional model.  2D dynamical states-space model?  Cluster on a few different state space models?

…but continue with exploratory.  Remember to split up SRI dataset into two columns.  
	

Miscellanous
———————
Might be interesting to fit a 5-dim first order auto-regressive model on the 5 datasets of interest, with iid observations.
