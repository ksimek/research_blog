* Write function to make point covariances parallel
* re-run training - did values improve?
    * reduced perturbation variance.
    * noise variance change?
* re-run reconstruction - are pathologies present?

Okay done.  Initial pass at linearization **fails to affect** training or reconstruciton results.  Basically a no-op.  Are these results legit?  Let's visualize the linearized model's direction vectors to see if we've resolve convergence issues.  Is it possible the linearization is being overridden somewhere?


**Visualization** 
`in_progress/visualize_bp_lines.m` - quiver plot of backprojection lines, as defined by the smallest eigenvector of the precision matrix.

After plotting, it's clear the mean direction isn't right.  Before:

After running "linearize_cameras.m":

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2014-03-18-bp_lines_2.png)

Notice how the lines shift upward without explanation.

Found bug: didn't align direction vectors before taking mean.  Added dot-product check.

BP lines now look good:  parallel versions of originals, minimal shifting.

**Test**

Re-running reconstruction...  no noticible change.

**Experiment**

Nothing seems to change the reconstruction.  I suspect a bug that is nullifying all our changes.  Strategy: make a dramatic change and see if reconstruction changes.  if not, there's a bug somewhere.

Approach:  Change bp-direction eigenvalue from 0 to be the same as the others.  

Expected outcome: Drifting in reconstruction should be nearly eliminated.

    Outcome:  Expected change was observed - drift mostly eliminated.

Next steps: trace the construction of GP posterior covariance, end-to-end.


**Exploration**

Rolling back changes from last experiment bit-by-bit until desired reconstruction vanishes.  

...

Weird, now everything works as expected -- no drift using camera linearization.  

**Observations**

Tried running linearization per-curve instead of per-camera, and the former shows more drifting than the latter but less drifting than per-point.  Basically as expected.

**Experiment**

Run on datasets 7-11.

Outcome: Results seem legitimate.

Cleanup
--------------

We have tried several things to fix this drifting issue, all of which mostly failed until now.  Now that we've found a cause of drifting and a fix, need to roll back each of the earlier changes one by one.  

###Re-add index optimization

(Disabled smooth index metaprior, because it is likely to have a bug.)

Seems to help some places, hurt others.  Some "binding" (?), causing bulging away from data:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2014-03-18-binding.png)

Looks red curve has a start index of -2, which is probably causing the bulge.  issue with attachment inference code, not index estimation.

In other places, originally over-extended curves are properly trimmed after index optimization. Before:

After:

Training
---------

Re-ran training using linearized cameras, and no notable change in results.  This was unexpected; we expected far less perturbation variance, since the linearized cameras don't want to drift anymore.

Ran a manual test, plotting marginal likelihood vs. perturbation variance between the trained value (2.3023e-04) and our anticipated ideal value (~1e-6).  Indeed, the optimal marginal likelihood is achieved at lower variances, suggesting the training routine has a bug.

The training routine uses a different routine for computing the likelihood, which may be flawed (possibly due to the new model we're using).  Work on it tomorrow.

BUG: training routine assumes precisions are based on noise variance of 1.0.  Fixed; no affect on perturb_smoothing_variance.

Training hypothesis - Index compression
---------------------
Idea:  possibly the indices are compressed, requiring deformation (stretching) to fit the data.  Thus, training would want the deformation variance to be higher.


What is the best way to get unit-rate spacing of indices?

1. oracle reconstruct, chord-length parameterize
2. chicken-egg: reconstruct, chord-length parameterize, repeat
3. chicken egg w/ independent curves
4. heuristic reconstruct w/ independent curves


TODO
------

* Fix training routine.  Goal: perturb_smoothing_variance ~= 1e-6
* compare model #5 vs. model #3 under the parallel camera model

Open issues
-------------

How best to compute marginal likleihood during model selection?  (point-wise linearized or camera-wise?)
