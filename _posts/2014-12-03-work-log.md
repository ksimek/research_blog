Notes from today's meeting with Emily

  Modelling repeated measure data for diads (e.g coupled osc)

  standard: multi-level model
      papers that introduced it?

      most doable in sass and R, 
          one piece in sass but not R

  Weighted sum of predictors
  multi-level - fixed effects model
      global average plus individual average

  What happens to residuals around lines.

  eg. my result is grand slope plus my difference, plus residual
      

  "what happens to residuals?"  what does that mean
      model residuals
      auto-correlation or partner covariation
      want both
      hack in R:  put them in as fixed effects.  lag-1 <-  don't totally understand this
      R package - NLME  nonlinear mixed effects models
          -> lme() function is most used
              -> correlation structure
              -> Type A: "variance functions"
                  -> NLME defines a default set of variance functions
              -> Type B: "correlation structures"
                  -> NLME defines a default set of CorrStruct classes
                     We may need to define our own
  SASS version
      - Emily will send the url
      - a "repeated statemnt"
          sets up structure on residuals (the "R matrix")
      - "type equals"
          the type we want in SASS-speak  un@ar1  "direct product AR 1"

  S or S+ are "paid versions" of R.  

  Questions
  ------------
  Where can I get sass?
      runs in VMWare
      runs through the internet through UA
      Emily has it running 



  Need:
  -------------
  example data 
  example results in SASS

  book: mixed effects models in S or S+ .  pinhiero bates
  niell: longitudinal data in R
