Implemented generic kernel function  
Implemented and tested derivative of generic kernel function  

---

Current: step through blind_tree_fitting.m

MAP point estimation is failing.  Is this because we're using the wrong prior?

Next: Train new prior

Then: resume stepping through blind_tree_fitting.m

Current: train new prior

done.  implemented with analytical gradient; converges in 25 iterations.

Saved to 'training_output/single_view_prior.mat'

Later:

    Test derivative estimation;  normal direction estimation
        plot each curve, and tangent/normal
