* [Modules](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpc-upgraded-cluster/cluster-faq#TOC-What-are-modules-) automatically set path and library paths for specific libraries.
* HPC has a nice [web interface]() for subitting and managing jobs.  ATM, the only way to get stdout and stderr outputs.
* Intel compiler can use openMP to automatically leverage coprocessor cards.  Can use same code 
* Thrust already installed (`module cuda`); boost is header-only.
* Apparently, the copropocessor cards run linux, and I can ssh into them!  Still unsure what the host address is.
