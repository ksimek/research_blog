running with 5mm in-plane variance.  Dataset 4 and 5's issues seem to be resolved.  Interesting, since we still have isotropoic offset veriance in-place, too.  

Can we get old issue to return by setting in-plane variance to zero?  

...

Yes.  And setting in-plane to nonzero and isotropic to zero?  

...

Yes.  But shifting is very significant, and motion is large and random
