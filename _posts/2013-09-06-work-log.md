WACV deadline has passed, but still working on reconstructing ground truth, because it's  a good test on the end-to-end system.

Open issues:

* weird issue with branching
* clear up math issue with branching


Branching bug
================

Fixed!  It was a bug in `infer_branch_points()` function.  I was assuming Corr.curve_sm used the same  index set as Corr.ll_means_flat, which it was not.

I wanted to use `Corr.curve_sm`, because it is precomputed in `corr_to_likelihood()`, and it would save me an extra semi-expensive call to the cubic spline smoother, `csaps()`.  In the end, I modified `corr_to_likelihood` to save the smoothing amount and used it to call csaps inside `run_wacv()` to re-smooth the curves.  At least `csaps` is faster (linear time) than computing the posterior mean (quadratic).

Test Results

Results on dataset 2:

Looks good!

All Results
------------

Running on all 11 datasets...

---

Matlab is running out of memory on the second dataset (apparently)

When running directly on second dataset, it's fine.  Is the pass on the first dataset leaking memory or something?

Maybe one of the mex files?

It's weird, because we've run on dataset #2 tens of times without this problem...

Now running directly on dataset #2 is resulting in a curve of over 1 million points.  investigating...

---

Solution: the image dimensions were reversed (should be nrows X ncols, not width x height).  The triangulations were nutso, and after projecting and resampling, the number of points was in the millions.  It's interesting that it's so easy to make this algorithm blow up; are there other; will need to keep an eye out for more benign ways to trigger this kind of explosion.

Ground truth issues

Encountered this error message when running on all ground truth datasets:

Dataset 6 looks to be totally crap; need to investigate.

Found a bug in `corr_to_likelihood` that led to out-of-bound indexing.
---

Looks like Liu never finished ground-truthing dataset `2010-01-26/arab_1_36`.  

Skipping for now; lets see if others are okay...

---

Dataset 9 is broken. investigating...

---

Dataset 9 seems not terrible, actually.  A few missing views on the hard-to-trace views of a few curves.

Some cuves were so short that they contained only one point, which violated an assert that requires all curves to be at least 2 points long.  Adjusted the bezier-to-sampled-curve code so that the final point is always included.

---

Finished running all.  issues

* dataset 1 is very rough
* datasets 6 was skipped
* datasets 7 - 11 are worthless.

Need to re-trace 6 through 11.

---

Finished re-trace of 6.  Whew, 90 minutes... that sucked.  Reconstruction looks good now.
 
TODO
------

* Finish tracing datasets 7 through 11.
* Work on attached-curve-multi-view prior and reconstruction.
