Finished implementing hessian approximation, and laplace approximation.  Two methods for laplace:
  
###Method 1: 

1. estimate hessian in reduced model space.  Assume diagonal model (not the case)

Result:

###Method 2

1. Take hessian from method 1
2. project into observation space.  Keep block diagonals only.
3. project back into reduced model space.

### Method 3:

1. Take hessian from method 1
2. project into observation space.  Keep *first two block diagonals* only.
3. project back into reduced model space.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2015-01-28-method3_result3.png)

Method 2 is the same as mothod 1, except the first off-block-diagonals are kept in addition to the block diagonal.
