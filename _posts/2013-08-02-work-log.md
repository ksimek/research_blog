Morning
------------

Researched telecommuting strategies.

Set up Google hangout: [link](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/89759369dd280ff225c298a7a4291745134e1d6f)

Set up IRC chat room: [link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ivilab&uio=d4)

Probably IRC will be best for general chat, Google Hangouts for screen sharing or group video chat.
