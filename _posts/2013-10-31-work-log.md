Resuming from yesterday's discussion about Markov sampling.  I was concerned about piecewise sampling of interpolated values with insufficient data being used.  After some thought, realized there's a better approach: construct blocks from input indices, not output indices.


Secondly: only use the markov approach when there's too much data to eat at once.  Those cases are also the ones with the least probability of poor-data issues.

TODO: sample branch points when sampling other points


symptom: 30 output indices, 1000 output indices
