WACV - extend to multi-view/tracking; fix reconstruction errors.

Working, but need to remove translation and scale perturb component.

Testing branch index and start index
--------------------------------------

* negative start index causes gaps
* positive start index causes overshot (pre-tails)
* tree base is shifting between view

TODO (new) 
--------
* Testing branch index and start index, and reversal
