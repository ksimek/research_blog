Rewrote training procedure from scratch and now getting much more sensible results.  The overall goal is to isolate parameters to try to make them as independent as possible; and then use one or two-dimensional optimization to estimate them.

First, I hard-coded several variables.  

* Rate variance is set to its theoretical value of 0.333 [as described here](http://vision.sista.arizona.edu/ksimek/research/2013/08/13/work-log/).  
* perturb_rate_variance is now zero -- it seems to be causing weird results probably due to overfitting.  Results are very sensitive to small changes of rate perturbatyion.  Could re-introduce later.  

Second, I estimated perturb_position_variance directly, by measuring the variance of all groups of initial points.

Third, estimated noise and smoothness variance under the assumption of near-infinite position and rate variance.  This follows from the theory of cubic-spline models, which places no penalty over initial position and rate.  Used gradient-free minimizer, `fminsearch`, which works well for two-dimensional problems.

Fourth, estimated perturb smoothing and perturb scale, using noise and smoothness variance.

Fifth, estimated position mean and variance directly.

Note: all this is done using heuristic indexing, not the marginal likelihood optimization.  This is another key change from earlier training.

**Result**: Much more sensible perturb smoothing parameter (~1e-5 vs 1e-4) and perturb scale (2.06 vs 0.9).  End-to-end reconstruction is much more sensible; curve is centered among triangulated points.

TODO: 

* train on run dataset with significant motion (wacv dataset #10; i.e. arab_6)
* iteratively update noise/smoothness and perturb smoothness
* iteratively update indexing after setting params


PERTURB_POSITION_VARIANCE MAY BE THE OVERFITTER!
