Rewrote training procedure from scratch and now getting much more sensible results.  The overall goal is to isolate parameters to try to make them as independent as possible; and then use one or two-dimensional optimization to estimate them.

First, I hard-coded several variables.  Rate variance is set to its theoretical value of 0.333 [as described here](http://vision.sista.arizona.edu/ksimek/research/2013/08/13/work-log/).  perturb_rate_variance is now zero -- it seems to be causing weird results probably due to overfitting.  Results are very sensitive to small changes of rate perturbatyion.  Could re-introduce later.  
Second, estimated perturb_position_variance directly, by measuring the variance of all groups of initial points.
Third, estimated overall noise and smoothness, assuming near-infinite position and rate variance.  This follows from the theory of cubic-spline models, which places no penalty over initial position and rate.  
Then estimated
