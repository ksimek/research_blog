Need to re-focus my efforts on getting WACV datasets working by December 10.  My recent efforts have shown good progress on the hard problem of inferring the index set under difficult conditions, but I only have about 2 weeks to get results and write the paper, so I should be focusing on a few quick-and-dirty fixes first (improved camera calibration, naive correspondence matching).  These fixes only apply to the super-clean WACV datasets, so they won't help for ECCV, but they'll get the paper out, which is what matters at the moment.

TODO today:
    
* save wacv results from old cameras
* supplant camera files with recalibrated ones.
* re-run with new cameras
* compare results (hopefully much improved)
* investigate possible bug with continuous index-correction, i.e. FIX_WORLD_T(or omit entirely?, or replace with quasi-newton?)
    * remember, this doesn't need to be fast
