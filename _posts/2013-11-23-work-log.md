Need to re-focus my efforts on getting WACV datasets working by December 10.  My recent efforts have shown good progress on the hard problem of inferring the index set under difficult conditions, but I only have about 2 weeks to get results and write the paper, so I should be focusing on a few quick-and-dirty fixes first (improved camera calibration, naive correspondence matching).  These fixes only apply to the super-clean WACV datasets, so they won't help for ECCV, but they'll get the paper out, which is what matters at the moment.

TODO today:
    
* save wacv results from old cameras
* supplant camera files with recalibrated ones.
* re-run with new cameras
* compare results (hopefully much improved)
* investigate possible bug with continuous index-correction, i.e. FIX_WORLD_T(or omit entirely?, or replace with quasi-newton?)
    * remember, this doesn't need to be fast

* better data curve subdivision
* invsetigate crap curve #2

Investigating bad reconstruction of curve 2
---------------------------------------

it was reversed. fixed.

Wait, now several views of several curves are missing.  Also, several corrections I remember making are now missing.  What is going on?  Did I somehow overwrite an old file?  Can I recover it from time machine?

...

Okay, recovered from time machine.  Still not sure what caused this.

Running WACV w/ linear-map correspondences
------------------------------------------

Getting NaN when estimating branch distance.  Coincident points aren't handled sensibly.  Fixed; also added handling of degenerate curves (single point repeated multiple times).

Running succeeded (FIX_WORLD_T is off).

The reconstructed result for dataset 8 looks good (for the first time ever), but the base point moves from view to view, even though we've removed the offset component from the kernel.

...

Found the problem:  had commented out some lines during debugging; caused offset perturbations to remain in the reconstruction.  

...

Enabling FIX_WORLD_T.  Rerun succeeded, result looks reasonable; seems 98% identical to the version with FIX_WORLD_T disabled.

...

Getting some attachment issues.  Deteched reconstruction shows a few curves were badly reconstructed. time to try new cameras

...

new cameras seem to be reconstructing everything in reverse???  is it an axis-flipping issue?

TODO (new)
--------------------

* Fix cameras
* Why is root point moving in the reconstruction?
* Try FIX_WORLD_T=true
* Consider running index point optimization
* run with denser point subdivision
