Spent most of the day finishing coding and compiling likelihood server.

Next: 
* build config file and make first run.
    * build camera files
* write matlab TCP client mex code
* send ground truth model from matlab to server 
* debug:
    * check rendering: silhouettes look okay?
    * check y-axis flipping issue
    * check likelihood vs. perturbed model vs. null model vs. overexpressive model

Issue: stem radius
-------------

Until now, our model and data have been infinitesimally thin curve (medial axis).  

Need to consider how to add width.  Options:
    
1. Train?  
2. Fixed?  (pass as CLI parameter to server)
3. Marginalize over? 
4. Optimize? 

Since we're on short time, I'm leaning toward 2 for simplicity.  

Building config file
-----------------------

Done, but need to double-check which dataset we're using in matlab at the moment.







Issues
-----------

When running batches of several datasets, need a way to ensure matlab and likelihood server are running on the same dataset.

There are some obvious hacks, but
