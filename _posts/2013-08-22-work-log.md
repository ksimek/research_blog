Computing \\(\mu_b\\) and \\(\Sigma_b\\)
=======================

<div> Since \(S\) is usually singular, we can't invert it, so we need to tweak yesterday's equations.  In what follows, the precision matrix \(S\) is decomposed into \(s s^\top\), which will allow us to keep the covariance matrix symmetric. 

<div>
The updated forumula for \(\mu_b\) is:</div>
\[
    \begin{align}
    \mu_b &= K_*^\top \left(K_{\mathcal{MB}} + S^{-1}\right)^{-1} y_{MB}  \\
    \tag{1}
          &= K_*^\top s^\top \left(s K_{\mathcal{MB}} s^\top + I\right)^{-1} s y_{MB}  \\
    \end{align}
\]

The formula for \(\Sigma_b\) is:

\[
    \Sigma_b = K_b - K_*^\top s^\top \left(s K_{\mathcal{MB}} s^\top + I\right)^{-1} s K_*
\]

Recall that \(K_b\) is the prior covariance of the branch point.
</div>

Predictive covariance question
-------------------------------
<div>
<p>
I realized during implementation that it isn't clear what the predictive covariance, \(K_*\), should be.  I know it's the covariance between the true branch point and the observed points in the markov blanket, but the observed points have associated view-indices, while the branch point does not.  After some thought, I realized that the covariance arising from view-indices is essentially *likelihood* variance in this context (i.e. imaging noise), and according to Williams and Rasmussen, these parts of the likelihood should be omitted when computing the covariance between data and true unobserved points.  (See equation (2.21), notice that off-diagonal elements don't include the noise variance, \(\sigma_n I\)).
</p>
<p>
To accomodate the use-case where you want to compute the covariance while ignoring view-index, I tweaked `kernel/get_model_kernel`; now, if you pass-in a `model_index` of zero, it returns a two-parameter no-perturb kernel where only spacial-indices are received.
</p>
</div>

`ll_indices_flat` vs. `prior_indices`
----------------------------------

There's some ambiguity in these two fields of a curve-track.  The difference is simply that in `ll_indices_flat`, indices *always* start at zero, whereas in `prior_indices` the offset `start_index` is added to all values.  In practice, there are rules for where these two fields should be used:
    
* when passing indices to a kernel, always use `prior_indices`
* When dealing with geometry (e.g. referring to a point along a curve), always use ll_indices.  That way, the position of the referred point is unchanged if `start_index` ever changes.

Task progress
================

* Finish `attachment/att_set_branch_index.m`.
* rough test of attachment stuff - (does it parse? does it run?)
    * It runs, but with buggy output for \\(\mu_b\\) and \\(\Sigma_b\\).
    * Found bug - incorrect re-indexing (xxyyzz to xyzxyz)
    * Now giving apparently good results.
* Implement efficient tree ML
* implement naive ML
* write tests
    1. compare against `curve_ml5.m` for independent curves
    2. compare against naive ML using full-covariance-matrix.
* invalidate children after calling attach/detach

Misc notes
==============
* should place a condition on \\(\Sigma_b\\).  If it's variance is too high, need to expand markov-blanket.  
* Add `model_type to params`
* Have "make_correspondence" initialize start_index, parent_index, branch_index.

chain of affects
=========================
How are children affected when properties of the parent change?
