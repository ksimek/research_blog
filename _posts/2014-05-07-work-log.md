Today I finished run #10 from yesterday, in which I tried whitening the data before doing inference.  The results were inconclusive but not encouraging.

I need to clean up the code which has gained some cruft from yesterday's tests.  I'm removing the whitening option, since it doesn't help with synthetic data, but I'll keep the whtening function for testing on real data later.
