Kalman smoother is tested and appears to be working well.  70% faster than direct method.

Queue
------
* Investigate "zero covariance" bug
* infer liklihood variance during reconstruction
* build pipeline, w/ intermediate results
* project 3D posterior into third view

Later
-------
* after projecting into third view:
** Add-remove curves 
** grow/shrink curves
** add/break branches

Today: Cleaning up and building pipeline

* move logic from tmp_track_all to a function
* write pipeline script - all input/output in one directory
* write intermediate output at each stage
** curve extraction
** branch estimation
** warping
** likelihood estimate
** pair-wise 3d reconstruction
** 3rd-view warping
** likelihood estimate
** 3-view reconstruction
** ...
** nth view warping
** n-th view reconstruction

for each view, keep likelihood estimate
