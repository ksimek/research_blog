Testing missing data in cluster model

Run #1 - enable missing data
----------

Segfault resulting from empty cluster.  Writing routine to create a cluster from worst point.

...

Still getting weird results.  Clusters are collapsing constantly.

Even a _single_ missing value screws up results.  There must be a bug in my initial estimate script

...

BUG: true/false swap when determining whether to use missing-data-enabled line fitting

...

Several bugs related to computing epsilon.  Fixed after several hours :-/

...

It seems we can continue to increase the missing percentage indefinitely, without the clustering suffering (or at least until an entire observation becomes missing, which isn't handled).  

Likely the small amount of noise is helping us a lot here.  We'll see how it works on real data.

Real FIRE data
-------------

High-level Tasks

1. merge radation data from Laura (into demograph dataset?)
2. for each subject, 
    first chemo
    last chemo
    first rad
    last rad
3. write results in FIRE data format

Reading and merging radiation data:
    
* construct out_db cols: subject_ID, had_radiation
* if row has start and end date, 
    * if out_db already has start or end date, record error
    * else record start and end date
* assert all "radiation=yes" have start and end date
    * can already see 57533 fails this test

Do same for chemo dates.

Merge chemo and rad.

compute "type"

...

All implemented in `in_progress/process_treatment_dates.m`.

Data consistency issues
----------------------

* some subjects surgeries occur after treatment
    * 57527, 57563, 575139, 575145
* Only 97 of 136 subjects have immune data
* some subjects disagree about treatment type
    * 57517 - no histo dates, but hist = 70
    * 575146, 575156 - demo:rad = yes, but no dates in rad_supl
