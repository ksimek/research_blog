Testing missing data in cluster model

Run #1 - enable missing data
----------

Segfault resulting from empty cluster.  Writing routine to create a cluster from worst point.

...

Still getting weird results.  Clusters are collapsing constantly.

Even a _single_ missing value screws up results.  There must be a bug in my initial estimate script

...

BUG: true/false swap when determining whether to use missing-data-enabled line fitting
