Old silhouette rendering technique is failing.  Point spacing is much tighter than before.  Our old algorithm relied on segment-ids matching between the first-pass and second pass to work.

Have a replacement algorithm that works reasonably well.  Basically edge-detection on the depth image.  The down side is we're getting double-edges in some areas, and you have to adjust a threshold.  It'll have to do for now, hopefully we can train a the likelihood to be robust to these issues.

Training Bd_likelihood
-----------------------------

added 'train_bd_likelihood()' function to 'lib/evaluate/bd_likelihood.h'.  Uses 'kjb_c::get_full_GMM()'  to fit a three-component gaussian mixture model to model the relationship between model and data pixels.



Refactoring
----------

Shader objects from './shader.h' are now in the project library, under 'lib/ogl/shader_2.h'.  Not the greatest name, but shader.h already exists and conflicts.  Consder refactoring them later.

Silhouetter rendering from './render_util.h' are now in 'lib/graphics/silhouette_renderer.h'.  Much better encapsulation now, so we can use it in other projects.  

In the process of updating './likelihood_server.cpp' to reflect these changes.  At the moment, getting an "invalid operation" when rendering.

It was a stray `glUseProgram(notzero)` in the shader loading code.
