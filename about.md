I am a research assistant and PhD student at the University of Arizona, studying computer vision.  This blog is intended to serve as a research journal, and I don't expect it to be of much public interest, but feel free browse if that's your pleasure.  I also host a [computer vision blog](http://ksimek.github.io), where I post things that might not be completely irrelevant.
