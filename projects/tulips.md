Etymology
------------------
Once upon a time, the TULIPS project stood for "Training and Unsupervised Learning and Inference of Plant Structure".

Though it made for a nice acronym, it was little more than a random collection of buzz-words that mostly fit.  Most problematic was the "Unsupervised" part, since our approach falls unquestionably into the category "supervised learning."  

Since the acronym is so cool and sooooo close to fitting, I've been looking on a better [backronym](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/backronym). 

One possibility is "Totally Uninvasive Learning and Inference of Plant Structure," which nicely describes a major benefit of the project, namely that plants don't need to be dissected in order to to be studied.  But "totally" is kind of a dumb word, and "uninvasive" isn't a word at all (see "[noninvasive](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/noninvasive)").  Moving on...

We can punt on the 'T' and just use a [recursive acronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym), so that just leaves the 'U'.

My current favorite is "Tulips Utility for Learning and Inference of Plant Structure."
